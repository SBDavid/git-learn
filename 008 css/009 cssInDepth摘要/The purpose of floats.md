Although floats were not originally intended to construct page layouts, they have
served that job well. In order to make sense of floats, however, we must first bear in
mind their original purpose.

A float pulls an element (often an image) to one side of its container, allowing the
document flow to wrap around it (figure 4.1). This layout is common in newspapers
and magazines, so floats were added to CSS to achieve this effect.
