/Users/jiaweitang/002-learn/flutter_learn_blur/ios/Runner.xcodeproj Building for iOS, but the linked and embedded framework 'App.framework' was built for iOS Simulator.

Deleting App.framework will cause it to be rebuilt on the next run and it will work correctly until you switch device types again. Running just flutter clean isn't enough, but you'll have to run it when you delete App.framework otherwise it will try to install the cached build.

Again this only occurs with Xcode 11.4/Simulator 11.4. I did a build for physical devices which created an App.framework. Attempted to launch with Simulator 11.4 running an iOS 13.4 image and it failed to launch. I switched the command line tools back to Xcode 11.3/Simulator 11.3, and without changing App.framework it still works.

在切换模拟器和真机之前，删除app.freamwork
