The [MaterialApp] configures the top-level [Navigator] to search for routes
/// in the following order:
///
///  1. For the `/` route, the [home] property, if non-null, is used.
///
///  2. Otherwise, the [routes] table is used, if it has an entry for the route.
///
///  3. Otherwise, [onGenerateRoute] is called, if provided. It should return a
///     non-null value for any _valid_ route not handled by [home] and [routes].
///
///  4. Finally if all else fails [onUnknownRoute] is called.
